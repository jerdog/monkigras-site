We have been lucky to foster a diverse group of people in our community since starting Monki Gras, and do our very best to create a conference environment in which everyone feels welcome.

This year we are once again running our diversity and inclusion program, sponsored by MongoDB, which not only includes a free ticket to the conference, but is designed to support folks from under-represented groups before, during and after the event. Please let us know if you have any other special accessibility needs in order to get the most out of our talks.

We provide mentors and a community welcome. The idea is to do more than just give away a free ticket to the event. We want to lower barriers to participation, and help create opportunities for people.  The program covers the full cost of the Conference Pass for 2 days. All food and beverages are included within the Conference Pass, including lunch and breakfast on both days, and a dinner on day one. Where possible we may be able help with travel and accommodation costs.

Our definition of under-represented groups in tech is intentionally wide. We would like to extend an invitation to all underrepresented groups; including women, LGBTQ+ folks, people of colour, people with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

This year we want to do a much better job of accessibility. Please let us know about any ability needs you have, and weâ€™ll do our very best to accommodate them.
