## COVID Protocol

Our goal is to ensure everyone feels safe at our conference â€“ attendees, speakers, organisers alike. In order to accomplish this, we need to set some parameters in place to keep things copacetic. We will be requiring a negative COVID test on both days in order to attend and participate with Monkigras.

## If I am vaccinated, do I still need to provide a negative test?

Yes, you will need to do a test on both days. We appreciate that you are vaccinated, however this does not mean you are not infectious.

## If I test positive, can I still attend?

Unfortunately, no you cannot. We will happily issue a refund and we appreciate you staying in to keep everyone safe.

## What if I tested positive for COVID recently?

We request that you have tested negative on the days of the event.

We will have a check-in table for your proof of negative test results, please arrive 30 minutes prior to the start of the event so you can show us proof or take a test on-site, as part of the registration process.

We appreciate your help in making this event successful and safe! We are looking forward to seeing everyone and enjoying coming together after this hiatus.

Masking is optional, and we are firmly about respect for those who choose to mask up, but a negative test result is not.
