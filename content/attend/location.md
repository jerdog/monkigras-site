We’re so back. Back to Shoreditch, that is. The venue this year is the **Tab Centre**, which sits alongside the Tabernacle Church.

## Getting there

You can easily to get the venue via tube, bike or foot (pending on where you are coming from).

The closest overground station is Shoreditch High Street. Old Street station is a short walk away (~10 minute walk), and Liverpool Street station ( is about a 14 minute walk).

## Airport

If you haven’t visited London in awhile (or before!), we have exciting news, the Elizabeth line is open! What this means is it is even easier (and cheaper) to get from Heathrow to East London. It’s super easy to get to Liverpool Street from Paddington.

## Room Block

We do not have a room block with discounted rooms, but there are plenty of great places to stay nearby.

[Art’otel London Hoxton](https://artotellondonhoxton.com/) seems to have the best rates and gets great reviews.

Some cool neighbourhoods to stay nearby if you would rather are **Bethnal Green** or **Islington**.
