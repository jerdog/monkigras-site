The developer conference about craft culture
{{< /lead >}}

We’re back on March 27th/28th 2025. Our theme this year is **Sustaining Software Development Craft** – open source and AI will feature significantly.

This is a conference for people interested in the human aspects of building digital products. Community and collaboration still matter in 2025.

The big question we want to explore is – how can we keep doing the work we do, when it sustains us, provides meaning and purpose, and sometimes pays the bills? We’re in a period of profound change, technically, politically, socially, economically, which has huge implications for us as practitioners, the makers and doers, but also for the culture at large.

Key themes will be sustainable open source, and a pragmatic look at AI, as it impacts the work we do. We’ll also go meta – crafts and skills are disappearing across the culture, so how can we maintain them, and why should we? You want a talk about what willow regeneration projects have to do with AI – this is the conference for you.

Open source is under sustained threat in the era of the open source rug pull, where companies build success through communities and open distribution, before changing to proprietary licenses.

Meanwhile AI is shaping up as a transformative technology – so how can software developers, both new industry entrants and experienced engineers, build skills and maintain their relevance in the face of the oncoming revolution?

As ever at Monki Gras we’ll properly lean into delightful craft experiences and tastings – notably with amazing craft beers and ciders, natural wines, great soft drinks, and truly excellent food. If you care about people and the future of the software industry you’ll get a lot out of it.
