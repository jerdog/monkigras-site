Please let us know if you have any other special accessibility needs in order to get the most out of our talks.\nWe provide mentors and a community welcome. The idea is to do more than just give away a free ticket to the event. We want to lower barriers to participation, and help create opportunities for people. The program covers the full cost of the Conference Pass for 2 days. All food and beverages are included within the Conference Pass, including lunch and breakfast on both days, and a dinner on day one. Where possible we may be able help with travel and accommodation costs.\nPlease apply here.\nOur definition of under-represented groups in tech is intentionally wide. We would like to extend an invitation to all underrepresented groups; including women, LGBTQ+ folks, people of colour, people with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged individuals.\nThis year we want to do a much better job of accessibility.

Our theme this year is Sustaining Software Development Craft – open source and AI will feature significantly.\nThis is a conference for people interested in the human aspects of building digital products. Community and collaboration still matter in 2025.\nThe big question we want to explore is – how can we keep doing the work we do, when it sustains us, provides meaning and purpose, and sometimes pays the bills? We’re in a period of profound change, technically, politically, socially, economically, which has huge implications for us as practitioners, the makers and doers, but also for the culture at large.\nKey themes will be sustainable open source, and a pragmatic look at AI, as it impacts the work we do. We’ll also go meta – crafts and skills are disappearing across the culture, so how can we maintain them, and why should we? You want a talk about what willow regeneration projects have to do with AI – this is the conference for you.\nOpen source is under sustained threat in the era of the open source rug pull, where companies build success through communities and open distribution, before changing to proprietary licenses.\nMeanwhile AI is shaping up as a transformative technology – so how can software developers, both new industry entrants and experienced engineers, build skills and maintain their relevance in the face of the oncoming revolution?\nAs ever at Monki Gras we’ll properly lean into delightful craft experiences and tastings – notably with amazing craft beers and ciders, natural wines, great soft drinks, and truly excellent food. If you care about people and the future of the software industry you’ll get a lot out of it.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Monki Gras","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  The developer conference about craft culture\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re back on March 27th/28th 2025.
